Q.10  How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML
table? With Example

We use the colspan and rowspan attribute, to merge cells in HTML. The rowspan attribute is for the number of rows a cell should merge, whereas the colspan attribute is for the number of columns a cell should merge. The attribute should be placed inside the <td> tag.

Example:=
          <table align="center">
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Age</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Akku</td>
  
            <!-- This cell will take up
                space on two rows -->
            <td rowspan="2">44</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>fahad</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
