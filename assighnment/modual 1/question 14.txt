Q.14  What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?.

The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. The <span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute. The <span> tag is much like the <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element and <span> is an inline element.

Example:=

A <span> element which is used to color a part of a text:
<p>My mother has <span style="color:blue">blue</span> eyes.</p>
