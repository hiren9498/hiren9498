Q.9  How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing? With Example.


Cellpadding specifies the space between the border of a table cell and its contents (i.e) it defines the whitespace between the cell edge and the content of the cell.

Example=
            
            
            
               <table cellpadding="value" >.....</table>
              where, value determines the padding 
            (space between the border of a table and its content)
