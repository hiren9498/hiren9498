Q.1 are the HTML tags and elements the same things?

Technically, an HTML element is the collection of start tag, its attributes, an end tag and everything in between. On the other hand an HTML tag (either opening or closing) is used to mark the start or end of an element, as you can see in the above illustration.

However, in common usage the terms HTML element and HTML tag are interchangeable i.e. a tag is an element is a tag. For simplicity's sake of this website, the terms "tag" and "element" are used to mean the same thing â€” as it will define something on your web page.

example:-
         <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
         <P>This is also a valid paragraph.</P>

         this is the tag.

element example:-

         <p>This paragraph contains <br> a line break.</p>
        <img src="images/sky.jpg" alt="Cloudy Sky">
        <input type="text" name="username">
